Your goal is to make as many correct guesses in a row (streaks). \nIn the regular mode you have 82 tries to make as many correct guesses and streaks as you can master.\nIn the Classic mode, you are on a timer to make as many correct guesses  and streaks as you can master under 24 seconds. The game ends when the player runs out of time. A game in each mode consists of opponents playing a best of seven games, The first player to win four games wins the challenge.
